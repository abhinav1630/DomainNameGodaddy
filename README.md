# DomainNameGodaddy

The project deals with fetching data from goDaddy api and check the availability of a list of domains(500 at a time). The search is based on attaching the entered keyword to the list of cities(For eg: Keyword: Casino  City: LasVegas) So the search will be CasinoLasVegas.com and LasVegasCasino.com.  I am also attaching a list of cities country wise. The text file name can be directly entered through the terminal and 4 files are generated namely: Prefix_availabel, prefix_notavailable, suffix_available, suffix_notavailable.
